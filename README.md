This is an implementation of Pong with an exploration of program organization and fragmentation.
This work is heavily inspired by the TechWithTim YouTube channel.

Before you can run this application you have to clone this repo, then from the root project directory install 
the dependencies (preferrably in a virtual environment) with the command `pip install requirements.txt` (from
the command prompt). You can then run the application by running the command (again from the command prompt) 
`python pong.py`, or if you're using a Mac, `python3 pong.py.`

The game is a multiplayer game and the keys to move the paddle (say, for the left player) are w: for up; and 
s: for down. The other player can use the up and down arrow keys for the respective purposes.

I hope you have as much fun playing this game as I had while developing it.
